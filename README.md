# RockbusterSQL
This repo contains a sample of SQL queries I used in analysing a Rockbuster video dataset. I completed this project as part of a Data Analysis course with Career Foundry.

Project Brief

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. As a data analyst for Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department, I am tasked with helping to launch strategy for the new online video service.

Key Questions & Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and theyexpect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are themain questions they’d like to answer:

  Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
  What was the average rental duration for all videos?
  Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
  Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
  Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
  
Data Set

I used data that contains information about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers and payments. A full data dictionary including ERD is included in the repo. All queries were completed in PostgreSQL.
